# PercolationJava
This is a Java language implementation of Programming Assignment 1 from https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/ course

I have used one WeightedQuickUnion data structure and no virtual sites. Backwashing problem is non-existent. Bonus memory test PASSED.

Testing correctness of Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 18 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), it checks the return
values of isOpen(), percolates(), numberOfOpenSites(), and isFull() in that order.
Tests 11 through 14 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
call the methods open(), isOpen(), isFull(), percolates(), and, numberOfOpenSites()
in random order with probabilities p = (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5). The tests stop
immediately after the system percolates.

Tests 16 through 18 test backwash.

Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.
